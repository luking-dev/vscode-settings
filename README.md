# Visual Studio Code settings

This is my own Visual Studio Code settings. Contains profile and extensions list, and instructions for installing them.

## Installation

If you are on Linux or macOS, type in a terminal:

```bash
$ sh ./install.sh
```

Or, if you are using Windows:

```bash
PS> start install.cmd
```

## Export

To export your extensions to a file, exec one of these files depending your Operating System:

Linux / macOS:

```bash
$ sh ./export.sh
```

Windows:

```bash
PS> ./export.ps1
```
